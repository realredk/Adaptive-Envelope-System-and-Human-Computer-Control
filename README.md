# Adaptive Envelope System for Environmental and Manual Control

Within this repository lies the culmination of our research into the symbiosis of human-computer interaction and environmental design through the "Dynamic Insulated Shutter System for a Double-Layer Building Facade." This project serves as a testament to our dedication to enhancing sustainability and occupant comfort in built environments through innovative, adaptive facade systems.

## Repository Contents

- `adaptive_envelope_arduino.ino`: Arduino sketch for controlling the adaptive facade system's servo motors based on temperature and light sensor readings.
- `adaptive_envelope_grasshopper.gh`: Grasshopper file for modeling and optimization of the facade system, enabling architects and designers to visualize and tweak the system's behavior.
- `adaptive_envelope_temp-test.MOV`: Video demonstration of the prototype's temperature sensitivity test.
- `adaptive_envelope_light-test.MOV`: Video demonstration of the prototype's light sensitivity test.

## Project Features

The system utilizes DHT11 temperature sensors and BH1750 light sensors, managed by Arduino, to adjust louver positions for optimal energy efficiency and indoor comfort. The Grasshopper model provides a computational framework for visualizing and optimizing the facade's design parameters.

### Implementation and Testing

Detailed instructions for hardware setup, including sensors and servo motors, are provided, along with guidance for utilizing the Grasshopper model for design purposes. The test videos demonstrate the system's responsiveness to environmental changes, validating the research findings.

## System Design and Interaction

Through the integration of temperature and light sensors managed by Arduino, coupled with the computational modeling capabilities of Grasshopper, our project advances the dialogue between architecture and its inhabitants. This dialogue is enriched by acknowledging and incorporating user control, thereby elevating the role of human agency in environmental adaptability.

## Research and Development

This project contributes to the field of human computer control and sustainable architecture by demonstrating the potential of adaptive facades to improve energy efficiency and occupant comfort. The GitHub repository serves as a platform for further development, encouraging collaboration among professionals and researchers to refine and expand upon the initial design.

### How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in the form of code improvements, design optimization strategies, and experimental findings. Feedback on the system's application in different climatic conditions and architectural contexts is especially valuable.
